# Special Thanks to Ajay Gangwal Sir:

### Firstly, i would like to thank Ajay Gangwal sir for providing a great opportunity to students around the world to learn and grow together. I am greatly impressed by his idea to make students as the "CREATORS OF TECHNOLOGY" and not the followers. I feel myself really lucky that i got a mentor like him. The way he teaches is the best.
