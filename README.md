# TSBPL-Speech üê¨

##### This is TSBPL :) your personal voice assistant

# Special Thanks to Ajay Gangwal Sir:

*Firstly, i would like to thank Ajay Gangwal sir for providing a great opportunity to students around the world to learn and grow together. I am greatly impressed by his idea to make students as the "CREATORS OF TECHNOLOGY" and not the followers. I feel myself really lucky that i got a mentor like him. The way he teaches is the best.
So talking about the task, this task is given to us as a project by Ajay Gangwal Sir:

###### "Convert the OS based program into a menu driven program using Python Code which will execute the required user query when user will give the input as a text."

####### This is the initial step of making the voice assistant.

##### So I have used python to create this project. It will assist you to perform various task in windows operating system like you can launch any program in your pc.

**Why TSBPL_ ?
